# Morocco
This is my assignment submission where I was tasked to create a site for an end-client to display some of her travels (more specifically Morocco in this case). This site utilizes HTML, CSS, and Google Fonts API.

You can view the live site at the following URL: https://mjihaduddin00.github.io/Morocco/

Thanks!
